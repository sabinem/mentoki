    The view serves as a tool to redirect the person who wants to book a
    courseproduct and send him to login and registration first, have him
    confirm his email, before he is brought back to do what he wanted to do.

    His intention is kept in the session and in the next parameter.
    It will be still there after he logs in or signs up, if he uses the
    direct way, that is shown to him for this.

    In case he just have to login, the next parameter is doing the job.
    In case he has to signup and confirm his email first, his intention is
    stored in the session. The signup form writes it into the database from the
    session, when he is first registered and the desk entry point (LOGIN_URL
    from the settings file, redirects him and sets his initial intention back
    during that proccess.

    So if the user signs up with a certain intention to buy a product,
    he is helped through the process of signup and does not have to search
    again, before he finally gets back to his desired purchase.
